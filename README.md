## Design
The design of the site is a multi page site which consists of a home, gallery, about and contact page. 
The original design was created using Balsamiq to get a wireframe mock up. There is little change to the header and footers in the final form of the site, there is a some change of layout in the main body on some pages, the gallery for example was changed to a masonry layout to include more images, inspired from the love running project gallery.

### Colour Scheme
Thr color scheme I chose was blue and white, I wanted to give a feel of being in the mountains surrounded by snow and blue skies to match the hero image I chose, The blue colors were extracted from the hero image using www.imagecolorpicker.com.
### Typography
The font I chose for the headings was Spectral SC and Cinzel, I chose Georgia for the paragraphs as it is a very popular font.
I used Google Fonts to import Spectral SC and Cinzel to my stylesheet.

### Imagery
I wanted imagery to reflect the photographer that was from Bavaria, a place with mountains and snow. I searched www.pexels.com and sourced my hero image, photographer profile picture, about images, gallery images and a background video for the home page.

## Features

### Current Features

The main feature is to showcase this photographers work via his gallery page where he wanted his prize winning photos displayed.
The site features a gallery, I chose a masonry design inspired by the Love Running project. Each page has a newsletter sign up feature above the footer.
I included a back to top button to allow users to jump back up to the navigation menu.
The contact page has an embedded Google map to allow users to see the address on the map for directions.
I created a logo to add to the header to fill an area that had empty space. I included a subtle background video on the home page for behind the main content and used opacity to ensure it was not a distraction.

Secondary features were to advertise himself and his contact information to generate future work and collaborations.

### Future Features

- Future features will include a video gallery as he intends to start using drones to capture video footage from aerial angles.

## Testing
I have tested the site on Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.
Firefox and Chrome returned no issues at various screen sizes, measure via Dev tools.
Internet Explorer returns slight display disruption, I expected this from Internet Explorer so I was not surprised.
I tested screen responsiveness for iphone 5, iphone SE, Samsung Galaxy 8, iPad Air, iPad Mini, Surface Pro 7.

### Validators
My original validation returned no major issues only two instances where syntax needed to be tidied up and fixed.


### Devices

### Lighthouse

### Bugs
- (Fixed) Issue of profile picture not displaying on the page. I added image into index.html instead of adding through style.css, this then resolved my issue.

- (Fixed) When I deployed onto GitHub pages my images did not load as the path began with a "/", i removed this as I researched that this can stop images loading on GitHub pages.
