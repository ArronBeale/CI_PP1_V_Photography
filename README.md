## Design

### Design Choices
The site is designed to reflect the home of the Photographer to bring a sense of a personal connection.
The imagery was selected to represent the mountains and snow of Bavaria.

### Color
The colors chosen were blue and white to blend in with the hero image which has snowtop mountains and a clear blue sky.
I then used the colors in the navigation and the footer.
The blue colors were extracted as a hex from the hero image using https://imagecolorpicker.com/
![Color selection image](https://github.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP1_V_Photography/blob/main/docs/features/color-selection.PNG)

### Fonts
The font selected to use for all headers was Sepctral SC, this gave the headings some definition to catch the eye.
The main paragraph font chosen was Georgia as it is a very popular font and easy to read.

### Structure
The site follows a familiar structure similar to alot of websites that are user friendly.
On arrival you are greeted by the hero image with a heading to show it is a photography site. Navigation links are immediatly visible on the right of the navigation bar.
A logo is visible on the left of the navigation bar. There is a total of four page:

- Home page, has a picture of the Photographer and has a list f awards he has received
- Gallery page, full of images the Photographer wishes to showcase
- About page, where visitors can learn more about the Photographer
- Contact page, where visitors can find contact information

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Images not showing on deployed site | Image file paths began with "/", fixed links to images and removed "/" at beginning of links. Research claimed this happens when hosting on GitHub Pages. |
| Div container did not have CSS applied.  | CSS rule had an error in syntax, was expecting ";" but had ":", replaced with correct syntax. |
| All font became very small | This was not a code issue, I had previously changed the zoom level of the browser to capture more in a screenshot. When I returned i forgot I had done this action, eventually I realised the error that was made. |
