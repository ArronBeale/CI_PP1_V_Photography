## Design

### Design Choices
The site is designed to reflect the home of the Photographer to bring a sense of a personal connection.
The imagery was selected to represent the mountains and snow of Bavaria.

### Color
The colors chosen were blue and white to blend in with the hero image which has snowtop mountains and a clear blue sky.
I then used the colors in the navigation and the footer.
The blue colors were extracted as a hex from the hero image using https://imagecolorpicker.com/
![Color selection image](https://github.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP1_V_Photography/blob/main/docs/color-selection.PNG)

### Fonts
The font selected to use for all headers was Sepctral SC, this gave the headings some definition to catch the eye.
The main paragraph font chosen was Georgia as it is a very popular font and easy to read.

### Structure
The site follows a familiar structure similar to alot of websites that are user friendly.
On arrival you are greeted by the hero image with a heading to show it is a photography site. Navigation links are immediatly visible on the right of the navigation bar.
A logo is visible on the left of the navigation bar. There is a total of four page:

# Design
The design of the site is a multi page site which consists of a home, gallery, about and contact page. 
The original design was created using Balsamiq to get a wireframe mock up. There is little change to the header and footers in the final form of the site, there is a some change of layout in the main body on some pages, the gallery for example was changed to a masonry layout to include more images, inspired from the love running project gallery.

## Colour Scheme
Thr color scheme I chose was blue and white, I wanted to give a feel of being in the mountains surrounded by snow and blue skies to match the hero image I chose, The blue colors were extracted from the hero image using www.imagecolorpicker.com.
## Typography
The font I chose for the headings was Spectral SC and Cinzel, I chose Georgia for the paragraphs as it is a very popular font.
I used Google Fonts to import Spectral SC and Cinzel to my stylesheet.

## Imagery
I wanted imagery to reflect the photographer that was from Bavaria, a place with mountains and snow. I searched www.pexels.com and sourced my hero image, photographer profile picture, about images, gallery images and a background video for the home page.

# Features

## Current Features

The main feature is to showcase this photographers work via his gallery page where he wanted his prize winning photos displayed.
The site features a gallery, I chose a masonry design inspired by the Love Running project. Each page has a newsletter sign up feature above the footer.
I included a back to top button to allow users to jump back up to the navigation menu.
The contact page has an embedded Google map to allow users to see the address on the map for directions.
I created a logo to add to the header to fill an area that had empty space. I included a subtle background video on the home page for behind the main content and used opacity to ensure it was not a distraction.

Secondary features were to advertise himself and his contact information to generate future work and collaborations.

## Future Features

- Future features will include a video gallery as he intends to start using drones to capture video footage from aerial angles.

# Testing
I have tested the site on Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.
Firefox and Chrome returned no issues at various screen sizes, measure via Dev tools.
Internet Explorer returns slight display disruption, I expected this from Internet Explorer so I was not surprised.
I tested screen responsiveness for iphone 5, iphone SE, Samsung Galaxy 8, iPad Air, iPad Mini, Surface Pro 7.

## Validators
- [HTML Validator Used](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS Validator Used](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

###  Results
My original validation returned no major issues only two instances where syntax needed to be tidied up and fixed.
Currently there is one error related to the newsletter form which is flagging the post method of push as an error.

## Lighthouse
While testing with Lighthouse my images were slowing the site down alot, I needed to compress all the images using [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/)
This is the results from compressing all my images including the background video on the home page:
![Compress Results 1](https://github.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP1_V_Photography/blob/main/assets/readme_images/compress1.PNG)
![Compress Results 2](https://github.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP1_V_Photography/blob/main/assets/readme_images/compress2.PNG)

![Compress Results 5](https://github.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP1_V_Photography/blob/main/assets/readme_images/bgvideo1_after.PNG)

After I reduced file size I was able to achieve the following Lighthouse scores.

## Bugs
- (Fixed) Issue of profile picture not displaying on the page. I added image into index.html instead of adding through style.css, this then resolved my issue.

- (Fixed) When I deployed onto GitHub pages my images did not load as the path began with a "/", i removed this as I researched that this can stop images loading on GitHub pages.
